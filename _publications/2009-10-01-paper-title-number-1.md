abstract: 'How important is committee assignment power in state legislatures? I argue that the effect of committee assignment power is conflated in contemporary literature. While influential, removing high-leverage individuals and states yielded significantly smaller estimated effects than the findings of Fourinaies and Hall (2018). Furthermore, I find that the observed effect showed higher match rates with negative agenda power, i.e., veto power.'
