Title: "Start or Save: Do Politicians Favor Seed Donors or Lifeline Donors?"
Collection: Work in Progress
Abstract: 'Whose interests do Members of Congress (MCs) defend in Congress? I compare politicians' speech patterns advocating for their seed donors, lifeline donors (i.e., largest donor during their most competitive election), and constituents' interests to determine which they prioritize most throughout their careers.'
