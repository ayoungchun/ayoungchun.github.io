    <section> <p style="text-indent: 30px;"> I have taught as both an instructor of record and a teaching assistant in a variety of courses covering themes in American politics, data analysis, and critical data theory. 
        I have taught both graduate and undergraduate students in small (18 students) and large (60 students) class settings.

        <h2>Instructor of Record</h2>
        <p>(Undergrad) Data in Theory and Practice (Spring 24 & Spring 25) 
            <p> <p style="text-indent: 30px;"> How is data produced and what are some problems that can arise in the production and interpretation of big data? This course has three main objectives: 
                (1) learning about types of deliberate and non-deliberate biases in creating and analyzing data, (2) gaining data literacy, and (3) discussing the social impact of biased data 
                and coming up with solutions. The course starts off by cover the problems of validity, reliability, and biases in data and statistics. 
                We also identify cases of biases in “influential” works and try to understand why the mistakes are critical from both a research perspective as well as a social justice perspective. 
                The second part of class focuses on gaining data literacy, namely learning how to read graphs, infographics, and tables. We’ll be answering questions such as 
                “what statistics should one be focusing on when looking at such figures,” “why did the author present this statistic here” and "is this statistics representative of the whole picture.” 
                Finally, the third part of the course will focus on discussing how biased data might hinder social justice, benefiting some communities and marginalizing others.</p>
