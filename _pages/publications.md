### Understanding Committee Assignment Power in State Legislatures
- **Abstract:**
  <details>
    <summary> Show Abstract</summary>
    How important is committee assignment power in state legislatures? I argue that the effect of committee assignment power is conflated in contemporary literature. While influential, removing high-leverage individuals and states yielded significantly smaller estimated effects than the findings of Fourinaies and Hall (2018). Furthermore, I find that the observed effect showed higher match rates with negative agenda power, i.e., veto power.

### First to Come, Last to Leave: An Analysis on Seed Donors and Politicians
- **Abstract:**

    <summary> Show Abstract</summary>
    Are all politician and donor relations equal? I argue that the first supporters to politicians when their odds were lowest (i.e. their first open seat primaries) matter more to them than other donors. Likewise, since donors have supported the candidates at their least favorable electoral point, they have vetted the politician based on their commitment to the donor’s policy preferences and perceived competence (Bawn et al 2023), and will be more loyal to them as well. I test the strength of such relationships by tracking first donor donations to the politicians across multiple elections. Looking at PAC donations to the 102nd Congress to the 115th Congress cohorts, I find that first supporters donate to more terms across candidates’ political tenures than bandwagoning interests and are more reluctant to cut ties with them, opting to oscillate in support rather than abandoning them.

### Seed Donors and Their Influence within Congressional Committees
- **Abstract:**

    <summary> Show Abstract</summary> 
    Legislators have sets of “seed” donors that had supported them when their electoral odds were lowest, i.e. during their first competitive primaries. From the donors’ standpoint, donors contribute to such candidates based on vetting them based on their commitment to the donor’s policy demands and perceived competence. In fact, donors undergo a costly vetting process to find candidates that would “champion” their policy preferences in Congress ( Bawn et al 2023). But how well do these champions legislate on behalf of their seed donors? This paper seeks to investigate whether legislators participate more actively in the legislative process when the issue at stake is related to their seed donors. I look at hearing transcripts from the 102nd Congress to the 115th Congress House committee meetings to see whether seed interests are represented in legislators’ committee activities. Specifically, I use unsupervised and semi-supervised machine learning methods to find clusters in speech and compare that to legislators’ identified seed donors. I also extract variables such as hearing participation and speech frequencies from the transcripts to find correlations between participation and whether the topic was related to their seed donors. I find that candidates advocate harder for seed interests than bandwagoning interests throughout their whole careers.

### From Start to Save: Do Politicians Favor Seed Donors or Lifeline Donors 
- **Abstract:**
    <details>
    <summary> Show Abstract</summary> 
    Whose interests do Members of Congress (MCs) defend in Congress? I compare politicians' speech patterns advocating for their seed donors, lifeline donors (i.e., largest donor during their most competitive election), and constituents' interests to determine which they prioritize most throughout their careers.
