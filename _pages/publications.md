### Bundled Power: Rethinking Committee Assignment Power in U.S. State Legislatures
 <div style="margin-left: 20px;">
<details>
  <summary> Abstract </summary>
What does "committee assignment power" actually measure, and what kind of political influence does it represent? While prior work (e.g., Fouirnaies and Hall 2018) treats assignment authority as a discrete institutional lever, I argue it functions as a proxy for a broader bundle of leadership powers. Using state-by-state regressions, I show that the estimated effect of assignment power on campaign contributions is highly composition-sensitive, driven by a handful of states and influential legislators. Comparing models with and without the assignment indicator, I find that its explanatory weight shifts to leadership offices such as Speaker and Senate President, while the Committee on Committees chair fails to absorb it -- suggesting that the variable captures more than the act of assigning members. Linking to Anzia and Jackman’s (2013) coding of procedural powers, I show that assignment power co-moves most strongly with agenda and gatekeeping tools. These findings reframe assignment authority as part of a broader leadership package centered on agenda control.

### First to Come, Last to Leave: An Analysis on Seed Donors and Politicians 
  <div style="margin-left: 20px;">
<details>
  <summary> Abstract </summary>
 Who supports first-time candidates, and why? This paper investigates whether pre-primary donors—“seed interests”—are more loyal over time than “bandwagon
interests” who begin giving only after a candidate wins their first primary. Drawing on PAC donations to freshman cohorts in the 102nd to 115th Houses of Representatives, I examine three dimensions of donor loyalty: longevity (total duration of
support), durability (likelihood of exit), and resilience (likelihood of returning after a lapse). Using OLS and Cox proportional hazards models, I find that seed interests support legislators for more elections and are 13% less likely to stop donating, with the most durable relationships found among donors to open-seat primary winners. Transition models show that seed donors are also more likely to resume support after a lapse, particularly when defined narrowly as early donors to open-seat winners.
PAC-level analyses confirm these patterns, while highlighting that donor resilience is coordinated at the interest-group level. These findings suggest that early donations—especially in open-seat primaries—reflect deliberate, long-term investments in access and influence, with important implications for understanding strategic donor behavior and legislative representation.

## Working Papers 
### Whose Champion? Investigating Legislators’ Priorities in Committee Hearings (Job Market Paper)
 <div style="margin-left: 20px;">
<details>
  <summary> Abstract </summary>
  Whose interests do legislators advocate for in lawmaking? The literature has extensively explored the incentives shaping legislators' behavior, with particular focus on the roles of donors and constituents. This study specifically examines the influence of early donors ("seed interests") on legislators' actions during committee hearings. By analyzing transcripts from committee hearings in the 107th to 117th sessions of the House of Representatives using supervised and semi-supervised topic models, and cross-validating the results with an AI assistant, I investigate whether legislators prioritize their seed interests over those of their constituents or largest donors, especially in relation to the electoral conditions under which these relationships were formed. The findings reveal that legislators are more likely to advocate for seed donors when they secured their seat through open-seat primaries followed by non-competitive general elections. In contrast, legislators show less consistent support for seed donors when elected through more competitive routes, where they are incentivized to appeal to the broader electorate. These results highlight a new type of interest group-legislator relationship that may help explain legislators' lawmaking behavior.

### From Donors to Desks: Tracing the Impact of Early Money on Committee Assignments
 <div style="margin-left: 20px;">
<details>
  <summary> Abstract </summary>
 I look at whether legislators try to sit in committees whose jurisdictions is related to their seed donors’ interests. I define committee jurisdiction in two ways: (1) by examining donations to committee members in the past election cycle and (2) by identifying where bills on specific policy interests were assigned from the floor. To test whether legislators join committees aligned with their seed donors’ interests, I analyze the match rates between MCs’ seed donor interests and committee affiliations over their careers. I also run a survival model, treating placement on a seed interest-related committee as an event, and compare the time it takes for MCs to join a seed donor interest committee versus a bandwagon interest committee. I find that most legislators secure a position on a seed donor-related committee by their fourth cycle, with Republicans doing so earlier and at a higher rate than Democrats.
