## Dissertation (Book Project)
### *First to Come, Last to Leave: An Analysis on Seed Donors and Politicians*
- Presented at MPSA 2024, APSA 2024
<details>
  <summary> Abstract </summary>
  Are all politician and donor relations equal? I argue that the first supporters to politicians when their odds were lowest (i.e. their first open seat primaries) matter more to them than other donors. Likewise, since donors have supported the candidates at their least favorable electoral point, they have vetted the politician based on their commitment to the donor’s policy preferences and perceived competence (Bawn et al 2023), and will be more loyal to them as well. I test the strength of such relationships by tracking first donor donations to the politicians across multiple elections. Looking at PAC donations to the 102nd Congress to the 117th Congress cohorts, I find that first supporters donate to more terms across candidates’ political tenures than bandwagoning interests and are more reluctant to cut ties with them, opting to oscillate in support rather than abandoning them.

### *From Donors to Desks: Tracing the Impact of Early Money on Committee Assignments*
<details>
  <summary> Abstract </summary>
  Do legislators seek committee assignments that grant access to policies favorable to donors? By tracking Members of Congress’ committee assignments over time, I analyze the likelihood of being assigned to committees tied to early donors, their chances of securing such assignments, and the time spent on these committees. The findings show that MCs actively pursue and succeed in obtaining assignments related to their seed donors.

### *Whose Champion? Investigating Legislators’ Priorities in Committee Hearings*
  - Presented at MPSA 2024, APSA 2024, WiLS 2024
<details>
  <summary> Abstract </summary>
  Whose interests do legislators advocate for in lawmaking? Literature has extensively explored legislators’ incentives, particularly focusing on the roles of donors and constituents in shaping their behavior. This study specifically examines the influence of early donors (“seed interests”) on legislators’ behavior during committee hearings. By analyzing transcripts from committee hearings in the 107th to 117th sessions of the House of Representatives, I investigate whether legislators prioritize their seed interests over their constituents or largest donors, especially considering the electoral conditions under which these relationships were formed. The findings reveal that legislators are more likely to advocate for seed donors when they have secured their seat through open-seat primaries that led to non-competitive general elections. In contrast, legislators show less consistent support for seed donors when elected through more competitive routes, where they were more incentivized to appeal to the broader electorate. These results highlight a new type of interest group-legislator relationship that may help explain legislators’ lawmaking behaviors.

## Working Papers
### *Understanding Committee Assignment Power in State Legislatures (under review)* 
<details>
  <summary> Abstract </summary>
  How important is committee assignment power in state legislatures? I argue that its effect is often overestimated in contemporary literature. While influential, removing high-leverage individuals and states yielded significantly smaller estimated effects than the findings of Fourinaies and Hall (2018). In fact, matching and dimension reduction techniques revealed that the observed effect is more closely associated with negative agenda power, i.e., veto power.
