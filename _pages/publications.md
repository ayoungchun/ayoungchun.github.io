### First to Come, Last to Leave: An Analysis on Seed Donors and Politicians (under review)

  <summary> Abstract </summary>
  Are all politician and donor relations equal? I argue that the first supporters to politicians when their odds were lowest (i.e. their first open seat primaries) matter more to them than other donors. Likewise, since donors have supported the candidates at their least favorable electoral point, they have vetted the politician based on their commitment to the donor’s policy preferences and perceived competence (Bawn et al 2023), and will be more loyal to them as well. I test the strength of such relationships by tracking first donor donations to the politicians across multiple elections. Looking at PAC donations to the 102nd Congress to the 117th Congress cohorts, I find that first supporters donate to more terms across candidates’ political tenures than bandwagoning interests and are more reluctant to cut ties with them, opting to oscillate in support rather than abandoning them.

### From Donors to Desks: Tracing the Impact of Early Money on Committee Assignments

  <summary> Abstract </summary>
 I look at whether legislators try to sit in committees whose jurisdictions is related to their seed donors’ interests. I define committee jurisdiction in two ways: (1) by examining donations to committee members in the past election cycle and (2) by identifying where bills on specific policy interests were assigned from the floor. To test whether legislators join committees aligned with their seed donors’ interests, I analyze the match rates between MCs’ seed donor interests and committee affiliations over their careers. I also run a survival model, treating placement on a seed interest-related committee as an event, and compare the time it takes for MCs to join a seed donor interest committee versus a bandwagon interest committee. I find that most legislators secure a position on a seed donor-related committee by their fourth cycle, with Republicans doing so earlier and at a higher rate than Democrats.

### Whose Champion? Investigating Legislators’ Priorities in Committee Hearings 
 <div style="margin-left: 20px;">

  <summary> Abstract </summary>
  Whose interests do legislators advocate for in lawmaking? The literature has extensively explored the incentives shaping legislators' behavior, with particular focus on the roles of donors and constituents. This study specifically examines the influence of early donors ("seed interests") on legislators' actions during committee hearings. By analyzing transcripts from committee hearings in the 107th to 117th sessions of the House of Representatives using supervised and semi-supervised topic models, and cross-validating the results with an AI assistant, I investigate whether legislators prioritize their seed interests over those of their constituents or largest donors, especially in relation to the electoral conditions under which these relationships were formed. The findings reveal that legislators are more likely to advocate for seed donors when they secured their seat through open-seat primaries followed by non-competitive general elections. In contrast, legislators show less consistent support for seed donors when elected through more competitive routes, where they are incentivized to appeal to the broader electorate. These results highlight a new type of interest group-legislator relationship that may help explain legislators' lawmaking behavior.

### Understanding Committee Assignment Power in State Legislatures (under review)
 <div style="margin-left: 20px;">
<details>
  <summary> Abstract </summary>
  How important is committee assignment power in state legislatures? I argue that its effect is often overestimated in contemporary literature. While influential, removing high-leverage individuals and states yielded significantly smaller estimated effects than the findings of Fouirnaies and Hall (2018). In fact, matching and dimension reduction techniques revealed that the observed effect is more closely associated with negative agenda power, i.e., veto power.
