I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Political Science at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). I study the role of rules and money in lawmaking. 

My dissertation explores how early donors influence congressional lawmaking. I identify a new group of extremely loyal donors, which I term 'seed donors'â€”those who contribute to legislators' first open-seat primaries. I examine the extent to which these donors' policy preferences are reflected in Members of Congress' legislative behavior, particularly in their committee assignments and committee hearing speeches.

Prior to UCLA, I completed a BA in Political Science and Applied Statistics at Yonsei University. 

Here is how to pronounce my name: AH (sound you make at the dentist) - young (as opposed to old).
