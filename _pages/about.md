I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Political Science at the University of California, Los Angeles. 

I study the role of rules and money in lawmaking. I am particularly interested in investigating the influence of pre-primary 'seed' donors on Members of Congress' legislative behaviors. My dissertation attempts to gauge lawmakers' prioirities in lawmaking by competing their "championing" efforts per donor, based on their history with the donor. With the focus being MCs' committee activities, I utilize supervised and semi-supervised machine learning techniaues on Congressional hearing transcripts to analyze MCs' short and long term speech patterns.

I study the role of rules and money in lawmaking. I am particularly focused on exploring how 'seed' donors influence the legislative behaviors of Members of Congress. My dissertation aims to assess lawmakers' legislative priorities by evaluating their advocacy efforts for each donor, taking into account their past interactions. Focusing on Members of Congress' committee activities, I employ supervised and semi-supervised machine learning techniques on Congressional hearing transcripts to analyze their speech patterns over both short and long terms.
