<p style="text-indent: 30px;"> Welcome! I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Political Science at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). I study the role of rules and money in lawmaking.<br>

 <p style="text-indent: 30px;"> My dissertation explores the influence of early donors on congressional lawmaking, focusing on a new group of highly loyal donors that I term ‘seed donors’—those who contribute to legislators’ first open-seat primaries. I investigate the extent to which these donors’ policy preferences are reflected in Members of Congress’ legislative behavior, particularly in their committee assignments and hearing speeches. By employing supervised and semi-supervised text analysis methods, and training ChatGPT to verify the results, I find that legislators increasingly seek committee positions related to their seed donors and actively participate in hearings aligned with these donors’ interests.

### Dissertation Highlights 
<ul>
 <li> Extremely Loyal Seed Donors: I find that donors who first supported politicians in their early, high-risk races—specifically, open-seat primaries—are more loyal than other donors. Analyzing PAC donations to freshman cohorts from the 102nd to the 117th Congress, I find these “seed donors” contribute across more terms and are less likely to sever ties, preferring to oscillate in support rather than abandon the candidates. </li>
<li> Seed Donor Interests’ and Committee Assignments: Examining MC's committee assignments over their careers, I find that they increasingly seek and succeed in joining committees whose jurisdictions align with their seed donors' policy interests. </li>
<li>  Seed Donor Advocacy in Committee Hearings: Analyzing transcripts from House committee hearings in the 107th to 117th sessions, I find that legislators are more likely to advocate for seed donors' interests—particularly when they secured their seat through open-seat primaries followed by non-competitive general elections—over the interests of district and largest donors. </li> </ul>


<b> Additional Research 
<ul>
 <li> Committee Assignment Power in State Legislatures: I find that the effect of committee assignment powers in state legislatures is often overestimated in contemporary literature. While influential, removing high-leverage individuals and states yielded significantly smaller estimated effects than the findings of Fouirnaies and Hall (2018) – in fact, the observed effect is more closely associated with negative agenda power, i.e., veto power. </li> </ul>
