I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Political Science at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). I study the role of rules and money in lawmaking. 

My dissertation explores the influence of early donors on congressional lawmaking, focusing on a new group of highly loyal donors that I term 'seed donors'â€”those who contribute to legislators' first open-seat primaries. I investigate the extent to which these donors' policy preferences are reflected in Members of Congress' legislative behavior, particularly in their committee assignments and hearing speeches. By employing supervised and semi-supervised text analysis methods, and training ChatGPT to verify the results, I find that legislators increasingly seek committee positions related to their seed donors and actively participate in hearings aligned with these donors' interests.

Prior to UCLA, I completed a BA in Political Science and Applied Statistics at Yonsei University. 




Here is how to pronounce my name: AH (sound you make at the dentist) - young (as opposed to old).
